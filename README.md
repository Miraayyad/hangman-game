# hangman-game
This Hangman game in Python challenges players to guess a hidden word one letter at a time, avoiding too many incorrect guesses. Players input letters, and correctly guessed ones are revealed. They win by guessing the word before running out of attempts; otherwise, the word is revealed, and they lose.
